# Digital-Filter-Design
• Designed FIR filters with complex conjugate zeros to analyze the effect of zero placement on frequency response
• Applied bandstop FIR filters to remove sinusoidal interference and enhance clarity in speech signals
• Developed second-order IIR filters using complex-conjugate poles to separate narrowband signals from noise
• Implemented lowpass filters using the truncation method and studied the impact of filter size on performance
• Simulated impulse and frequency responses in MATLAB for audio and signal processing applications
• Analyzed FIR and IIR filters to compare stability, efficiency, and accuracy trade-offs
